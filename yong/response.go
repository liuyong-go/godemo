	ContentLength int64

	// nil, means that "identity" encoding is used.

	// Uncompressed reports whether the response was sent compressed but
	// was decompressed by the http package. When true, reading from
	// Body yields the uncompressed content instead of the compressed
	// content actually set from the server, ContentLength is set to -1,
	// and the "Content-Length" and "Content-Encoding" fields are deleted
	// from the responseHeader. To get the original response from
	// the server, set Transport.DisableCompression to true.

	// The Trailer initially contains only nil values, one for

	// Trailer must not be accessed concurrently with Read calls
	// on the Body.

	// After Body.Read has returned io.EOF, Trailer will contain
	// any trailer values sent by the server.
